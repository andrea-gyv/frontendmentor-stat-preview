## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

to place an overlay color on an image in css

I tried my best to make the alternating columns in mobile / desktop view.
The padding and layout is not the exact same though. I tried my best, I think I have been lost with the many properties.

I managed to use the grid of the bottom section, placed vertically and horizontally on different modes.
I am new to this, it was harder than I thought.

```

### Useful resources

I have used google to find solutions
and have used some ideas of Kevin Powell's YT video where he solved a previous frontend mentor challenge that I completed earlier.
